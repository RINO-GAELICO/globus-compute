To use globus-compute, follow these steps:

1. Install the Globus CLI by running the following command: `pip install globus-cli`.

2. Authenticate with Globus by running `globus login` and following the prompts to log in with your Globus credentials.

3. Create a new compute endpoint by running `globus endpoint create --personal`.

4. Connect to your compute endpoint by running `globus endpoint connect <endpoint_id>` where `<endpoint_id>` is the ID of your compute endpoint.

5. Upload your compute script or files to the compute endpoint using `globus transfer <source_path> <destination_endpoint_id>:<destination_path>`.

6. Submit a compute task by running `globus task create --name <task_name> --endpoint <endpoint_id> --command <command>` where `<task_name>` is the name of your task, `<endpoint_id>` is the ID of your compute endpoint, and `<command>` is the command to execute on the compute endpoint.

7. Monitor the status of your compute task by running `globus task show <task_id>` where `<task_id>` is the ID of your compute task.

8. Retrieve the output files from your compute task by running `globus transfer <source_endpoint_id>:<source_path> <destination_path>`.

Remember to replace `<endpoint_id>`, `<task_name>`, `<command>`, `<task_id>`, `<source_path>`, and `<destination_path>` with the appropriate values for your setup.
